%%% Objective

%%% 1. L'un des objectifs de ce mémoire consiste à évaluer les changements dans l'aire de répartition de la communauté de la forêt nordique du Québec ainsi que son taux de migration sous l'effet des changements climatiques 

%%% 2. Lorsque l'on parle de migration et de changement d'aire de répartition d'une espèce dans ce cas-ci d'une communauté, on s'intéresse particulièrement à la distance et au de migration. 

\begin{frame}{Introduction}{Objective}

\textbf{Main objective:} Assess range shift and migration rate of the temperate forest community toward boreal forest under climate change.

\pause 

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Why ?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Predict the future distribution of temperate species community in Quebec
		 	\item Improve and adapt our forests management practices under CC
		\end{itemize}

The surface of the boreal-temperate forests ecotone is \textbf{expected to shift in the next decades}.

%%% Tools

%%% Quand on s'intéresse au changements d'aire de répartition d'un communauté, deux processus sont à prendre en considérations:
\begin{frame}{New approach}{Which tool is more appropriate?}

\textbf{Forest have:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Limited dispersions
			\item Slow population dynamics
			\item Successional stages based on facilitation and/or competition processes
		\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1em}
\pause
\textbf{To predict species range shift, we need to include \alert{two processes:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Distance of colonization %(Seeds dispersion ability): Size of the patch, ecological knowledges
		\item Dispersal rate %(immigration and establishment phases). 
		% Ces deux processus vont être altérer sous l'effet des CC
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\alert{Those processes are affected by the future climate}
